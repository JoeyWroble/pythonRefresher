Assignment 1 for Topics in CS![Echo code](<Screen Shot 2025-02-07 at 6.36.33 PM.png>) This is my code for the echo part of the assignment. The code takes a user input and 'echoes' it back. The 'echo' function contains a for loop that iterates through the input text from the end 3 times. The loop creates a new line with \n from 3 characters, 2, to 1. ![Fibonacci code](<Screen Shot 2025-02-07 at 6.49.02 PM.png>) This is my code for the Fibonacci Sequence. the code starts with a timer function that counts the time the program takes to execute each term of the sequence. The "fib" function is the Fibonacci formula. The sorted_points variable stores a list pairing the time taken to execute, with the number in the sequence. The remaining code creates the plot for the numbers and the time it took to execute.![Graph of Fibonacci sequence](fib.png) Resulting graph.
